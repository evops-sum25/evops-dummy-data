In a saturated insurance market, companies are constantly looking for new ways to attract customers. This requires rapid testing of various hypotheses and ideas. Your task in this track is to develop a web service that will allow you to create and test new insurance products. This service should help companies quickly test the effectiveness of various hypotheses by creating digital insurance products with minimal time and resources.\n\n2️⃣ A service for project management. In a large company with many projects, information about them is often scattered across various systems and formats. This leads to difficulties in management, lack of transparency and loss of time to search for relevant data. Your task in this track is to develop a web service for centralized storage, convenient display and monitoring of large projects within the company.\n\nWhat awaits the participants at the hackathon?\n🔸 Solving a real business problem from a large insurance company\n🔸 Communicating with experts and getting feedback\n🔸 Meetups, check points, final presentation and award ceremony\n\nTimeline of the hackathon \"Code of Consent\":\n🔹 September 27 at 23.59 – completion of registration.\n🔹 On September 28 at 12.00 – the opening of the hackathon and the publication of tasks.\n🔹 On September 28 at 12.30 – the opening meetup, experts will tell you more about the tasks.\n🔹 On September 30 at 19.00 – the first checkpoint.\n🔹 On October 3 at 19.00 – intermediate checkpoint.\n🔹 On October 5 at 14.00 – the final check point.\n🔹 October 5 at 20.00 – the end of uploading projects.\n🔹 October 6 at 12.00 – announcement of the finalists.\n🔹 On October 6 at 14.00 – pitchings of the authors of the best projects.\n🔹 On October 6 at 20.00 – the award ceremony for the winners.\n\nDo not miss the large—scale competition - join the hackathon \"Code of Consent\": ",

Vernadsky.\n\nThe lecture will cover the following topics: Optimization problems, involving finding maxima or minima, are frequently encountered and are introduced as early as school, during the study of derivatives. However, the apparatus of derivatives (or gradients, in the case of multivariable functions) is not suitable for all optimization problems. For example, the objective function for finding the minimal radius sphere covering a given set of points is non-differentiable at an infinite number of points.\n\nIn this lecture, we will review examples of well-known nonsmooth optimization problems related to data analysis (such as LASSO regression and the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix with a non-Euclidean quality metric). These approaches can be useful in combating overfitting and addressing the instability of the standard least squares method in the presence of data anomalies or outliers. We will discuss key concepts from subgradient theory and numerical methods for solving nonsmooth optimization problems, highlighting some of their fundamental characteristics. In conclusion, we will briefly touch upon some contemporary works in this field and suggest topics for possible collaborative research (including course and thesis projects).\n\n📆 September 30, 17:40—18:50\n🧭 Location: Room 106\n🇷🇺 Language: Russian\n👉 VK livestream: ()",

Through interactive activities, i.e., analysis of authentic dialogues in film, role-plays, and comparison of politeness strategies in English with those in their native languages, students will foster a deeper understanding of how language reflects cultural expectations.
